**Data-visualization--by-using-Seaborn--function-in-python**


This project explores data analysis and recommendation systems for elective courses at Presidency University. It utilizes a dataset (presumably "Book_1.csv") containing student information related to their courses.

Data Exploration and Visualization:

Data Import: The code imports libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Data Cleaning: Basic data cleaning steps might be happening (though not explicitly shown in the provided snippet).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The code performs various visualizations to understand the data:
Course code distribution is analyzed using sns.histplot.
Average marks (200) are plotted by course using sns.barplot.
Additional visualizations like boxplots, scatterplots, or histograms might be used depending on your final analysis.
Data Preprocessing for Recommendation System:

Feature Selection: The code defines potential features for the recommendation system, including:
Course Code
Marks (200)
Grade
Grade Points (potentially calculated based on the 'Grade' column)
Text Conversion (Optional): The code snippet hints at potential text conversion to tokens, but the current data doesn't seem to require it. This step might be relevant if processing textual course descriptions in the future.
Note: The provided code doesn't explicitly show the model training or recommendation generation steps.

Next Steps:

Implement a recommender system algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) using the chosen features.
Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system based on metrics like precision, recall, or recommendation accuracy.
Develop a user interface for students to interact with the recommendation system.
Future Enhancements:

Incorporate additional data sources like student preferences or course descriptions.
Explore advanced recommendation techniques like hybrid approaches or matrix factorization.
Overall, this project lays the groundwork for a personalized elective recommendation system for Presidency University students.
